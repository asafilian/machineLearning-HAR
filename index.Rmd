# Overview
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit, it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

In this project, our goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available on http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har. The goal of this project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. 

The data for this project come from an article written  by W. Ugulino *et al*.^[http://web.archive.org/web/20161224072740/http:/groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har - Ugulino, W.; Cardador, D.; Vega, K.; Velloso, E.; Milidiu, R.; Fuks, H.

DOI: 10.1007/978-3-642-34459-6_6]. In [Sect. 2](#sec-data), we split the data into training and testing datasets. Then, we take a look at the output variable. 

We do some pre-processing on our tarining set in [Sect. 3](#sec-preproc). This includes removing some harmful variables, dealing with missing values, standardization data (Gaussian distribution), excluding the variables with high correlations, and applying principal component analysis (PCA) on the data.

[Sect. 4](#sec-models) is dedicated to building some reasonable model(s), including *linear discriminant analysis*, *classification trees*, *k-nearest neighbors*, *support vector machines with a non-linear kernel*, and *random forests*. We use 10-fold crossvalidation to estimate the accuracy of our models. The most accurate models that we get in this case are random forests and k-nearest neighbotes. The former is a little bit more accurate than the latter. We finally test our model on our testing dataset. The result is promissing. 


# Data {#sec-data}
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(caret)
library(ggplot2)
library(RANN)
library(dplyr)
library(corrplot)
```

In the following, we load our data, and we split it into two sets, `train.set` and `test.set`. We will build our models on `train.set`, and we will test whether it overfits or not on `test.set`.

```{r getdata, cache=TRUE}
dataset <- read.csv(url("https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv"), header=T, na.strings=c("","NA"))
dim(dataset)
```

```{r split}
set.seed(2)
inTrain <- createDataPartition(dataset$classe, p = 0.7, list = FALSE)
train.set <- dataset[inTrain, ]
test.set <- dataset[-inTrain, ]
dim(test.set)
dim(train.set) 
```

As we see, the dataset has ``r dim(train.set)[2]`` variables. The output of our predictors is the `classe` variable in our dataset, which is a categorical variable with the following levels: ``r levels(train.set$classe)``.  Now, let's take a look at the `classe` (the output) variable:

```{r perc-classe}
percentage <- prop.table(table(train.set$classe)) * 100
cbind(freq=table(train.set$classe), percentage=round(percentage, 2))
```

# Preprocessing {#sec-preproc}
In this section, we do some preprocessing on `train.set`. This includes removing some harmful variables, dealing with missing values, standardization data (Gaussian distribution), excluding the variables with high correlations, and applying principal component analysis (PCA) on the data. We save the preprocessed data into a variable called `train.set.proc`. 


Let's first take a look at the first two variables of the dataset:

```{r}
str(train.set[, 1:2])
length(unique(train.set[, 1])) == dim(train.set)[1]
```

We must remove the first variable, as it is just an ID for the observatios. The second variable is username. If we include it in our model, then it will be a prediction for a limited number of people. Therefore, we exclude these two variables from our training set. 
```{r}
train.set.proc <- train.set %>% select(-c(1, 2))
```

Now, we are going to remove the varaibles that have more than 50% missing values. Let us first see which variables have missing values. In the following script, we  extract all variables that have NA values and save their indices in the `ids_NA.1` varible. 

```{r whichNA}
whichNA <- function(dat){
        inds <- NULL
        for(i in 1:dim(dat)[2]){
                if(anyNA(dat[, i])){
                      inds <- c(inds, i)  
                }
        }
        inds
}
ids_NA.1 <- whichNA(train.set.proc)
m <- NULL
for(i in 1: length(ids_NA.1)){
        m <- c(m, mean(is.na(train.set.proc[, ids_NA.1[i]])))
}
unique(m)
```

So, there are `r length(ids_NA.1)` variables out of `r dim(train.set.proc)[2]` variabels which have some missing values. As we see above, for each of these variables, about `r round(unique(m), 2)*100`% of its values is missing. Since our training set is a very large data set with many other varaibels, it does not make sense to impute these variables with NA values and keep them as predictors.  Therefore, we simply discard these variables as follows:

```{r preproc-NA}
train.set.proc <- train.set.proc[, -ids_NA.1]
dim(train.set.proc)
```


Now, we normalize the numeric variables in the training set. We use the methods  `YeoJohnson`, `center`, and `scale`.^[The `YeoJohnson` method make the data look more normal. We could use the Box-Cox method, but the `Box-Cox` method does not work when you have negative values.] 

```{r preproc-normal}
is.fact.2 <- sapply(train.set.proc, is.factor)
num_inds.2 <- which(!is.fact.2)
preObj_stn <- preProcess(train.set.proc[, num_inds.2], method = c("YeoJohnson", "center", "scale"))
stan_data <- predict(preObj_stn, train.set.proc[, num_inds.2])
train.set.proc[, num_inds.2] <- stan_data
```


In the following script, we extract the variables with near zero variability:

```{r zerovar}
isN0 <- nearZeroVar(train.set.proc, saveMetrics = TRUE)$nzv
colnames(train.set.proc)[isN0]
```

As we see above, there is only one variable, ``r colnames(train.set.proc)[isN0]``, in the training set with near zero variability. We are going to exclude it from our dataset: 

```{r preproc-zerovar}
train.set.proc <- train.set.proc[, !isN0]
is.fact.3 <- sapply(train.set.proc, is.factor)
num_inds.3 <- which(!is.fact.3)
```

Now, let us take a look at the correlation between the numeric variables. Here, using by the `corrplot` package, we plot the correlations. 

```{r corplot}
cors <- cor(train.set.proc[, num_inds.3])
diag(cors) <- 0
corrplot(cors, order = "hclust", title = title("Correlation Plot", line = -25))
```


We now exclude the variables with high correlations (with `cutoff` 0.75) from the dataset. To this end, we take advantage of the `findCorrelation` function to searche through the correlation matrix and returns the indices of the corresponding variables. 

```{r preproc-cor}
highCorr <- findCorrelation(cors, cutoff=0.75)
num_cor <- length(highCorr)
train.set.proc <- train.set.proc[, -highCorr]
is.fact.4 <- sapply(train.set.proc, is.factor)
num_inds.4 <- which(!is.fact.4)
dim(train.set.proc)
```

So, ``r num_cor`` variables were removed to reduce the pair-wise correlations. 


Now, we would like to preprocess the data with the PCA method. We are going to get 95% of the variance of the data, which is the default `thresh`^[A cutoff for the cumulative percent of variance to be retained by PCA] for precessoning with PCA in the `preProcess` function. We save the result in  a datset variable called `train.proc.pca`: 

```{r preproc-pca}
preObj_pca <- preProcess(train.set.proc[, -dim(train.set.proc)[2]], method = "pca")
train.proc.pca <- predict(preObj_pca, train.set.proc[, -dim(train.set.proc)[2]])
train.proc.pca$classe <- train.set$classe
dim(train.proc.pca)
```

Now, we got ``r preObj_pca$numComp`` principal components, the original variable `cvtd_timestamp`, and the output variable `classe` in our dataset. Let us just take a look at the `cvtd_timestamp` varaible:  

```{r cvtd_timestamp}
percentage <- prop.table(table(train.proc.pca$cvtd_timestamp)) * 100
cbind(freq=table(dataset$cvtd_timestamp), percentage=round(percentage, 2))
```
